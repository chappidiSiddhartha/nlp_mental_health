Sentiment Analysis for Depression and PTSD Detection

Project Overview
In the digital age, social media plays a crucial role in society, providing a platform for individuals—especially youth—to exchange views on public issues and express personal challenges. This extensive data offers a unique opportunity to study human behavior and mental health trends.
By applying sentiment analysis to timely data from social media platforms like Twitter, we can predict mental health challenges such as depression, anorexia, and PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Early detection of depression is crucial, as it serves as a root cause of numerous other diseases and is often linked to suicidal tendencies. Proactively identifying mental health issues can significantly reduce the associated risks and help individuals seek timely assistance.

Project Goal
This project focuses on detecting depression and PTSD among Twitter users by analyzing their tweets. The aim is to predict the likelihood of users suffering from these mental health conditions based on the sentiments expressed in their posts.
 
Methods and Approaches
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	Text cleaning
o	Tokenization
o	Removal of stop words, special characters, and redundant data.

Models Implemented:
1.	Naive Bayes Classifier
o	A probabilistic model that leverages word frequencies for sentiment classification.
o	Strength: Quick and interpretable results.
2.	Random Forest Classifier
o	An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees for better prediction.
o	Strength: Handles overfitting better than individual decision trees.
3.	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
o	A recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies.
o	Strength: Excels in understanding the context of sequential text data.
 
Importance of the Work
•	Mental Health Awareness: Early detection of mental health conditions is essential for providing timely support.
•	Societal Impact: Reducing mental health stigma by using technology to address concerns.
•	Preventive Measures: Minimizing suicide rates and fostering healthier communities.
 
Results
Each model was trained and evaluated using the preprocessed dataset. All of the three models performed well,Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest Algorithms  performed slightly better than  LSTM 
This notebook demonstrates the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques in analyzing social media data for early mental health intervention. Each model offers unique advantages depending on the complexity and size of the data. 
By continuing to refine these models and expanding the dataset, we can create more robust systems to detect and address mental health challenges in society.
